# Django-Portfolio-public
By creating a portfolio website on Django, I have acquired a range of valuable skills. Throughout the project, I learned to utilize Django, a powerful Python web framework.

I learned how to create data models in Django, allowing me to define the structure and data types for portfolio elements such as projects, works, and contact information. I delved into working with databases, including using Django's ORM to interact with the database.

While developing the Django portfolio website, I gained proficiency in managing routes and views. I created routes for various pages, such as the home page, project page, and contact page, and then developed corresponding views to render these pages.

I also explored working with Django templates, enabling me to create dynamic pages by incorporating data from the database. I became proficient in using Django's template language to insert variables, loops, and conditional statements into the templates.

During the process of building the Django portfolio website, I also learned about form handling. I created forms for submitting messages through the contact page and processed incoming data to store it in the database.

Overall, creating a Django portfolio website allowed me to apply and enhance my knowledge of web development, databases, and templating. This project provided me with valuable experience and enabled me to create a professional website showcasing my work and development skills.
